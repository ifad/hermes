Hermes
------

This app allows site owners to insert help elements in their site: tooltips,
banners, tutorials.

It works by requesting the embed of a `.js` file in the site, and then it
establishes a channel through which, for each page load (FIXME) a payload
is requested from the app, that describes the help elements to display in
that specific page.
