This almigthy file implements the connection between Hermes and the target
site during Tip authoring. It opens up the target site in a pop-up window,
so 90's, with a specific URL fragment to enable the authoring component in
hermes.js, that works much like WebKit's and FireBug inspectors.

Then, after selecting and clicking onto an element, its CSS selector is
calculated (roughly) and it is passed back onto the window.opener to be
then stored in Hermes' DB.
